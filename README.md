# InflTokenomics


### Influencer Economy 

There are powerful intrinsic properties of the influencer/fan economy that are unlocked by the token economics. Most tokens fail after the initial fever is over in 4 months, and a majority of tokenomics out there do not model the unique features of its own economy. Our influencer and fan economy has well-known properties such as engagement and is expected to have emergent properties that are yet to be fully realized. Engagement models can be best financialized with the INFL token that is designed to reward loyalty and earliness, discourage financial speculation and is flexible enough to accommodate emergent properties. That’s why we have designed our economy with inflationary and deflationary properties, anti-speculation taxes, long term rewards and mechanisms and exciting features to transact on engagement.  

There are intrinsic values to the engagement models offered by the influencers. A private dinner with an influencer, if offered, could be easily floor-priced at a fiat price. An auction mechanism for that said engagement model could easily discover the market price. Aggregation of all engagement models across all influencers and their fans in the economy indicates its gross domestic product. Therefore the inflow economy has an intrinsic valuation that can be crudely estimated at the engagement supply as validated by demand prices. Since the supply is asymmetrically and severely limited, the cost of supply becomes irrelevant, and a chance/raffling mechanism multiplies the GDP manifolds. As the facilitator of this GDP, INFL token (and network) will earn outsized returns through formal and informal mechanisms. Transaction fees can be considered as formal mechanisms, and the treasury uses them as burn mechanisms to transfer the fee income to the economy without adverse regulatory implications. Emergent propertie can be considered as informal mechanisms. A collectible influener NFT that can be priced initially as x with a y% yield to the network may appreciate 1000x. Cultural significance of an emergent class such as influencers who didn’t even exist a decade ago cannot be intrinsically valued properly today.  

# Tokenomics 

INFL has one of the most innovative tokenomics in the market designed predominantly for its unique influencer economy with market enhancing and stabilizing functions. Fans are not required to understand the intricacies of this exciting economy, much as no citizen in real life is expected to understand how the central bank determines macroeconomic policy. However, fans would intuitively know that a) the INFL token is used to achieve personal engagement with the influencer, that b) it rewards early and stable loyalty, and that c) it appreciates and gives back as the influencer’s cultural significance increases.  
# Absolute commitment to the Influencer and Community.  

60% of the token supply is reserved for the fans and the community. Along with another 20% reserve for the influencers, INFL has one of the smallest development and team incentives in the market with 80% reserved for those who make this exciting economy possible.  

# Rewarding early loyalty 

INFL ICO will be priced at $0.05USD. Fans and investors can buy 20% of the launch supply (200,000,000 tokens) at this price. Right after, launch our atomic treasury swap will be activated with a sigmoid bond curve at $0.20. The pricing curve will be designed to reward early fans and investors with a curve inflection point around $5.00 most likely within 18 months according to our usage estimates and a maturity price around $10.00 within 3 years. While the ICO holders will be locked up for a year, their tokens will appreciate 4x right after the ICO ends and atomic swapping with our treasury starts at $0.20. We fully expect a secondary market developing within 6 months of launch enabling all investors to freely transact the token, and the treasury will serve the purpose of dampening volatility with its innovative pricing and liquidity system.  

# Rewarding loyal and stable fans 

Fans will be able to use their tokens to purchase all kinds of exciting engagements from their favorite influencers in our engagement marketplace. Loyalty will bring two distinct and valuable advantages to the fans. If a fan stakes their tokens for 12 months, they will get even more exclusive engagement models or 25% discount on existing engagements in the marketplace. If they stake their tokens for 24 months, then they get almost one-of-a-kind engagement and/or 50% discount. Meanwhile the price of their held tokens will increase thereby making their investment very attractive. Staked INFL tokens also earn 10% APY annually.  

A most loyal fan with $10,000 invested at INFL ICO receiving 200,000 tokens holding it two years may benefit from: 

2 years staking: 40,000 more tokens thereby bringing the total to 240,000. 

Exclusive engagement models at year 1 and year 2 (eg. raffle for All expenses paid Inflow Summit attendance with 100 influencers) 

50% discount on all engagements (eg. dinner with influencer) 

Token price potentially increasing +100x.  

Influencer economy provides financial incentives to investors who believe that the engagement via the utility token brings an intrinsic value to the token. The generous staking APY at 10% especially at non-volatile / mature price points also provides an intrinsic value above and beyond the price appreciation. Staking mechanism with token yield inflates the supply thereby making the economy more accessible to many more fans via the influencers.  

# Community Building with Inflation 

Fiat currencies work with inflation for all kinds of legitimate reasons. Our exciting economy must also invigorate itself by adding more influencers and fans thereby creating emergent properties and network externalities. The network incentivizes influencers to join by issuing new tokens to them. This new token supply will be capped at a maximum of 5% per annum and will provide a non-stagnant tool for replenished activity via new influencers.  

# Preserving Value with Deflation 

While not technically true, it is said that the number one goal of a country’s central bank is to fight inflation (deflation may also be bad if unchecked). Our tokenomics have built in deflationary tools in its smart contract to not only counterbalance invigorating inflation that moves tokens around and to new entrants but may also provide an overall deflationary pressure when tokens are indeed moved. All sales transactions via the treasury will levy a 10% burn. If someone wants to sell 100 tokens back to treasury, 90 of them will kept in circulation and 10 will be burned forever. All INFL transactions touching the smart contract will also have a 2.5% transfer tax that will burn the tokens as a transaction fee. If someone buys an engagement at the marketplace for 100 tokens, 2.5 tokens will be burned. Depending on the token velocity, the transaction fee is expected to provide the overall deflationary trend for the token.  

# Creating Income for the Community 

Treasury also taxes sales transactions at 10% on a spread basis to a) fund its liquidity, b) discourage speculative selling, and c) to allocate its income to burning more tokens on a periodic basis. If someone wanted to sell 100 tokens to the treasury, 10 gets burned as a burn tax, then the treasury calculates the price on the 90 tokens according to its curve and takes a 10% spread fee on that transaction.  

# Initial Coin Offering 

ICO holders will be automatically locked up for 1 year and will earn staking rewards. When the lockup is lifted, they can sell their tokens back to the treasury at the prevailing treasury prices or sell at the secondary markets. They can also purchase engagement at 25% discounted rates or purchase exclusive items.  

# Buying and Selling at Treasury 

Fans and investors can buy tokens anytime they want at the treasury utilizing automated market making capabilities. Early buyers will benefit from the sigmoid pricing of our economy, and late buyers will be adversely affected. Selling at the Treasury is taxed at a gross 20% (10% for burn tax, and 10% for spread fees). Buyers can immediately spend the tokens at the engagement marketplace to purchase the different and exciting influencer offerings. Buyers can stake the tokens for one year or two year intervals to unlock rare benefits and an ability to purchase engagement at deeply discounted levels.  

# Onboarding Influencers 

Inflow Network believes that each and every one of its influencers are one of a kind and deserve a lot. Each influencer receives $50,000 in INFL tokens when they join its economy as a sign-up bonus. More economic benefits accrue to the influencers as they add their customized engagement models to the marketplace, get their fans to engage in the ways they want, reward their most loyal and stable fans via the tokens, and most importantly financialize things they already enjoy doing. According to our modeling, an influencer with solid engagement models and fans who enjoy such engagements can easily monetize millions of dollars via the INFL token while giving back millions of dollars to the fans who make this all possible.  

Influencer gets $50,000 worth of tokens when they are able to provide $50,000 cost-worth of engagement models to the economy. One exclusive dinner with 10 fans, 100 story reshares, 1000 special birthday wishes may cost the influencer nothing but would be worth $50,000 to their fans.  

$50,000 cost-worth equates to at least $500,000 value-worth of engagement in the INFLOW economy due to inherent supply/demand asymmetries, chance and auction mechanisms, and pricing inefficiencies. Influencer immediately receives 30% of such multiplier without risking the ire of the fans for price gouging given that the “abstracted” network shoulders the methods and modes of economy. For example, a dinner with one fan may actually cost $500 for the influencer and can be atomically priced at $5,000. But a $10 raffle for that dinner is price inelastic for any win-probability so the overall value can be realized at $50,000. At the onset, influencer turned $50,000 cost-worth to a $200,000 value-worth in tokens. With an estimated 100x appreciation in token value, joining the network with $50,000 worth of engagement can be a $20 million investment in a year or two.
